# WebScrapping
The webScrapper.py file reads the Banggood offers page and prints some of this offers to the user.
It does it with the web-scrapping tecnique.

The offers are stored in a list of lists, which is a list a product.
Every product (the inner list) stores his name, the actual price, the previous price and the percentatge of discount.

Additionaly, the programme sorts this list by the percentatge of dicount, showing to the user the offers with a major discount first.
